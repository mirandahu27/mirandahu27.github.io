									<h1>Being Trans in Prison</h1>
									<p>"I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me during this transition." - Chelsea Manning</p>

								<p>Prisons are generally separated by men and women, and has been considered heteronormative spaces due to this segregation. They are always cisgender, and people are generally placed into prison with the genders they were assigned to at birth. It has been said that this was done to protect and honour the safety of those within the prisons, and create a more manageable space. The problem isn't necessarily separating them, but that there are no alternative locations that can accommodate those who don't identify as a binary gender. Conditions within male prisons and female prisons can always vary largely. Male prisons are often seen to exhibit hypermasculinity and self-valuing trait obsession. Male prisoners who do not fit into this schema are always left to be discrimated, ostracized and abused.</p>

								<p>One of the biggest issues with being transgendered in prison is the hormonal medications that transgendered members need to take that are confiscated. There have been many documented cases that medications of those who required them were removed, and one of the largest media example cases of this is the Netflix Original series <i>Orange is the New Black</i>, where a transgendered black woman played by Laverne Cox needed hormone medication but was deprived of them. Another documented example is the real life case of Chelsea Manning (<i>b. Bradley Manning</i>), an individual who was born as a biological male, but had transitioned to a female within prison. Manning was sentenced to a prison sentence of 35 years, and throughout those years, exhibited extreme medical symptoms which lead to suicide attempts and other hazardous actions. Manning was sentenced for leaking to an online site called <i>Wikileaks</i> hundreds of thousands of classified military and government documentation relating to the American military and diplomatic events as a former U.S. soldier to an all-male military prison. Manning underwent gender affirming surgery during her sentence, and sued the United States Department of Defense for refusing medical treatment for gender dysphoria. Finally, in May of 2017, her remaining sentence was commuted by the former president Barack Obama, and became a notorious figure of the prison-based transgender society.</p>
