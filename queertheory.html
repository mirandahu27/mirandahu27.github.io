									<h1>Queer Theory</h1>
									<p>"Heteronormative behaviour and herd mentality is dangerous. It's okay to be different. It's okay to stand out for whatever reason. Some people are just born that way and instead of trying to tear them down, learn something new. Be curious and open because maybe that's a pathway for you too." - Rose McGowan</p>

								<p>Queer theory is a theory that emphasizes the fluidity of sexual nature. It diverges away from the natural definitions of the heteronormative model, and expands beyond the notions of sex, gender, and sexuality. One of the biggest concepts of queer theory is <a href="definitions.html">heteronormativity</a>, which acted as a supposed baseline for genders and sexuality. There are authors who have used queer theory as a theoretical approach to expressive writing. One great example is the reading <i>"Trans embodiment in carceral space: Hypermasculinity and the US prison industrial complex"</i> by Rae Rosenberg and Natalie Oswin, and gave consideration to the LGBTQIA2S+ community, and implicated that prison workers were too implicated in constructing and upholding heteronormative hierarchies. Doctors would withhold hormone treatments, guards have inflicted violence on trans people, and many other forms of upholding. One of the largest concerns was the accessibility of hormones, which would help alleviate symptoms of depression, stabilize emotions and prevent isolating experiences.</p>
								<p>"Gender regulation is a standard element of social control within carceral institutions and is a fundamental aspect of the interactions between prisoners and correctional officers. In particular, harassment and violence in men’s prisons indicate performative elements of carceral masculinity, which establishes hierarchies of failed and successful hegemonic masculine expressions” (Rosenberg & Oswin, 2015, p. 1277)</p>
								<p>Authors focused their theoretical approach with the topics of identity, experience, and normalization, which analyzed the different <i>norms</i> of gender, sexuality, race, class, etc.</p>
