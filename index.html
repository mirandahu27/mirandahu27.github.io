								<h2><a href="#">Heteronormative Spaces</a></h2>
								<p>Heternormativity has always been prevalent throughout society, and it has constantly affected the lives of those part of the LGBTQIA2S+ communities. Though we now have lots of access to information about these communities, we still know very little about the lives of individuals that are part of these communities within different environments.</p>

								<p>Heteronormative spaces are more prevalent in everyday life than naturally seen by the eye. Some of the examples of prevalent instances include gendered washrooms, sports stereotypes, gender segregation,  and domestic segregation. These are difficult subjects for individuals to discuss, which in turn makes it difficult to spread awareness of these events.</p>
								<p>Have you ever walked into a shopping mall and didn't think twice about the washroom you were heading to? <br /> That may just be one of the most evident instances of heteronormativity. Society has pushed these archetypes of splitting washrooms between cis genders, and have only recently started accepting the transition to all gendered locations. Amenities for bathrooms have historically been provided to the binary genders they were stereotypically designed for, such as infant change tables within women's bathrooms. These forms of stereotypical division make it difficult for those who may not identify with the genders indicated on the restrooms to be comfortable with entering them.</p>
								<p>Another large instance of heteronormative spaces includes sporting events and locations. Men were always stereotypically deemed as athletic, and although biological evolution and genetics do suggest men have evolved to become stronger individuals, it does not mean that women are unable to compete at a level equidistant to those of men. Society has placed a label upon women of weakness and fragility. Not only does this ingrain a mindset within women of weakness within sports, it creates an overall effect upon women, making it feel necessary to employ double the effort just to be able to reach a level on par with men. At sporting events, such as the 2010 Olympic Games, there have been countless instances where competition stadiums were modified to "accommodate" women.</p>
								<p>With this portrayal of frailty within women, heteronormativity not only spans public sectors, but also domestic environments. Houses have become accommodated to being a "female space", with typical family structures being envisioned by society of having two parents with a heterosexual orientation and around 2-3 children. Women have been portrayed to maintain cleanliness, support children, act as a cook, and pursue at-home roles of maintenance.</p>
								<p>We need to continue to raise awareness of heteronormative spaces and stereotypes, and continue to support and help strive gender cultures, equality, and comfortability.</p>
								<p>Below are some resources that can help you increase your awareness of these stereotypes and heteronormative spaces.</p>
