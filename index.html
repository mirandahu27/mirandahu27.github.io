											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The Mississaugas of Scugog Island is a First Nations community located in Ontario, Canada. They are a branch of the Mississauga Ojibwa (Anishinaabe) people, who are Indigenous to the Great Lakes region of North America. The Mississaugas have a historical and cultural connection to the lands surrounding Lake Ontario, including the area that is now Scugog Island and the broader region.</p>
										<p>Scugog Island is located in the central-southern part of Ontario and is part of the traditional territory of the Mississaugas. The community on Scugog Island has its own governance and is recognized as a First Nation by the Canadian government. Like many other First Nations, the Mississaugas of Scugog Island have their own governing council or band council responsible for managing their affairs, including matters related to education, healthcare, housing, and economic development. They also negotiate with the government on issues related to land rights, self-governance, and other matters of importance to their community.</p>

														<h3>'My heart will always be with my community': Kelly LaRocca is now in her fifth term as chief of the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation</h3>
														<p>Published June 3, 2023</p>
													</header>
													<p>As Kelly LaRocca worked toward completing her law degree, she looked forward to returning home to serve her community — the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation. To her surprise, however, LaRocca’s uncle, Gary Edgar, himself a former chief of the MSIFN, advised her that the timing wasn’t right just yet. “You need to gain a broader frame of reference and experience in the mainstream community and learn about how things work outside of the first nation. Flex your academic muscles and put them to good use in the mainstream so that you can build your skills and have that experience come and benefit your community later,” recalled LaRocca of that conversation with Edgar. “I think that was the best bit of advice he could have given me. To this day, I’m very thankful for it.”</p>

														<h3>Mississaugas of Scugog Island Powwow marks the Return of the Heartbeat</h3>
														<p>Published July 18, 2023</p>
													</header>
													<p>From the beauty and elegance of the Jingle dance to the power and warrior spirit on display for the Woodlands dances, from the steady beat of the drummers to the colours and pageantry of all the participants, the Powwow on Scugog Island this weekend was an unforgettable event. The 25th annual Powwow at the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation on July 15-16 – Return of the Heartbeat – was also a huge success, with thousands of visitors making the trek north of Port Perry for two days of dancing, drumming, songs and traditional ceremonies. The Powwow is an annual gathering and celebration of Indigenous culture that takes place on the Scugog Island First Nation. It’s an opportunity for Indigenous people to come together to celebrate life, honour people past and present, and share their culture with others...</p>
